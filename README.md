# GloveAndRobotArm
This repository includes the source code of the project along with a README file including instructions on how to launch the code.

Instructions:

Upon running the provided code, the user is to ensure that the integrated nano arduino/botboarduino board is properly connected to the computer's port.

1.Launch the Arduino IDE program.

2.Open the source code "FinalRobot.ino".

3.Select the connected board and port from the top dropdown menu. (make the board is Arduino Nano as this option was used to while developing the project)

4.After ensuring the selection of the proper board along with the port and if the botboarduino was used navigate to tools>board and choose the Atmel ATmega328P option.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When executing the code more than once the user is to confirm that both the Arduino IDE's serial plotter and serial monitor are closed as this will cause an error and prevent the code from uploading. This will also happen if two or more windows of Arduino IDE are open simultaneously. 
The IDE must be opened inside its related directory/file.
